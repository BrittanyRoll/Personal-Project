I'm Brittany Rollins, and here's a little information about me. I'm 16 years old, and in september I will be entering my junior year. I run track (300m, 600m, 200m, 400, and 400 hurdles). I also play the viola. I was in an orchestra for several years outside of school. I have written a few songs for the viola and want to perform what I've written someday.
I got into coding partially because I saw the movie the Internship and realized how cool it would be to be able to code (especially for a living). I hope to improve immensly ove rthe summer and will continue to learn after the end of the summer session.
