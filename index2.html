I'm Brittany Rollins, and here's a little information about me. I'm 16 years old, and in september I will be entering my junior year. I run track (300m, 600m, 200m, 400m, and 400m hurdles). I also play the viola. I was in an orchestra for several years outside of school. I have composed a few songs for the viola and want to perform what I've composed someday. I also love to read. My favorite genres are sci-fi and romance. One of the best books I've ever read is <em>The Island of Dr. Moreau</em> by H.G. Wells, and I recommend that everyone read it. 
I am an avid supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement and a proud feminist. In school, I encourage others to speak out against injustice online and in person. I also facilitate many discussions about race, sexuality, gender, and the other social identifiers that are often hard to talk about due to feelings of privilege and lack thereof.</p>
<p class="p2" style="text-indent:40px">
Some of my goals are to learn as many languages as I can and to travel to as many places as I can in my lifetime. I hope to one day be fluent in French, ASL, Italian, Arabic, Portuguese, and many other languages. Part of the reason I want to learn languages and travel is because I believe that languges give insight on the views and values of ther cultures, and to have global awardeness is to live an enriched life.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-indent:40px">
I became interested in coding partially because I saw the movie The Internship and realized how cool it would be to be able to code. I hope to solidify what I am learning over the course of four weeks during the summer and will continue to build my portfolio after the end of the summer session. I and others will be able to view my progress through this webpage.</p>
<p class="p4" style="text-indent:40px">
I wish to attend a college that will give me the opportunity to enhance my skills in languages, coding, pschology, or anything else I wish to pursue. Another priority I have on my college checklist is the ability to study abroad for a long period of time. It should also have a good support system and good job connections.
